## Usage

Running and deploying this app should be fairly straight forward. The app can be deployed via Node or Docker. As this is a proxy the primary steps is generating the static contents by transpiling any React components via `npm run build`.

The styling of this proxy uses Styled Components, so if the services this proxy serves also uses Styled Components there is a chance that the hash generated by styled components overlaps with those of another service. While the chance is low, it should be noted that this overlap is possible and may disrupt the styling of the item page in general.

## Requirements

- Node
- Webpack CLI
- MongoDB (for local development)
- Docker (optional for deployment)

## Development
